Dama has demonstrated to me in the last few days that he is honorable, a team player, fair, active in the community, and has a reliable history in Mount Augusta. I satisfied in my ranking of these two candidates, and I will happily serve either with them as a co-judge, or under them as a citizen.

Aimuari has worked hard to put together our new Constitution; I can't think of anyone to be a better arbiter of it than one of its primary constituents. Please vote Aimuari.

&#x200B;

While Aimuari has put together the new Constitution, Robokaiser has brought up plenty of dissonances he sees between the older parts of our legislation and current MTA practice/culture. He strives to serve as a judge that is defined by MTA, rather than one who defines it. This is an act of nobility I find hard to match. Please vote Robokaiser as well.

I hope to serve as a sort of mediator between Aimuari and Robo's approaches, bringing my own to the table. In my efforts to maintain total transparency in this election, I ask you to vote the three of us for the three Judge positions. Thank you for your time.]",[1. ImperatorMendes],"[1. citylion

Insofar as I dislike breaking my nonpartisan approach to elections, I offer the following notes on my choice of vote. My vote does not reflect my personal feelings towards the candidates or my judgement of their worth in the city; all the candidates have contributed different things to MtA and for that they all hold my respect. 

Squareblob and R3Y_J04N are my preferred candidates this election as I feel they are less partisan than the others. It is important for the mayor to promote unity rather than fuel factional divisions.

---

This is the very last I'm going to talk about Augustan politics this election. I just want to explain my reasoning real quick.

I don't want to put multi-mega alliance, regional values over Augustan values. I don't want to be under fire for constant, controversial pearlings or foreign policy decisions (I do enough of this in SATO anyway). I would much rather align Augustan principles with developing Civ and being a productive healthy nation instead of starting wars with every alliance that exists under the sun.

I don't argue that City hasn't done so many things for the city and Square hasn't. I'd much rather consider about the fact that Square has successfully kept the peace in Mount Augusta for the last three months and I would much rather like to keep it that way. Yeah, sure, Square may not be as active in game but he is a pretty good guy to say the least. 

The reason I'm voting for Square is that I want the Augustan future to be relatively secure. Call it personal principle, call it anti-semitism, call it injustice to Citylion, but this is my opinion and you can't change it.

**/u/TheHobbyist94 you gov. lawyer - I have the legal right to protest**

---

**I am protesting the election rules that require us to register seven days before an election in order for our votes to  count.**

*People have been voting in real life for thousands of years. Voting should be tied to property ownership. Which goes in line perfectly with the dereliction process we already have.*

**Make it simple:**

+ Take a snap with the voters tree and link a pic to your plot with cords (you may have more then one property, so you pic the one that you use the most).

+ The government adds your name to the voter list

+ If the property you listed is ever derelict then you have to re-register to vote following the same process above.

*This way the election officials only have to check one record each election (property record, which only changes with dereliction) and anyone on that list can vote anytime they want whenever they want*.

ComradeNick, I'm voting for, voting for ComradeNick

You're looking kinda sexy, Commie (skrt!)

You make me kind of hard (skrt, skrt!), Commie

Comrade is the best, I wanna suck his dick

I love his big vault and I love his juicy tits (skrt!)

Wanna cuddle up in Mumble with you ComradeNick

Maybe kill a couple newfriends (or some antisemites)

I want to text you every day and night, Mr. ComradeNick

Maybe send a couple nudies (Hey, watcha doin')

I wanna lick ya down, head to toe

But I promise I won't touch the hole (unless you want me)

I saw you for the first time on CC

I thought maybe me and you could get kinda freaky (yeah)

Hit that G-spot

Stick your pinkie up my asshole

And if you like it maybe you could try it too (skrt!)

If one finger ain't enough we can go for two

Maybe use a newfriend or a slave too

Commie, drill my ass with a prot set

Make me cum without using my hands on

I love you Commie, you make me cry

Cum in my mouth, cum in my eyes

Cum in my ass, cum on the tip

Cum on my back, cum on my tits

ComradeNick, ComradeNick

ComradeNick, I love you Commie

ComradeNick, ComradeNick

ComradeNick

Let me see that ass, Commie (prra, rra, rra!)

I just want to feel your pulse

With my pinkie in your asshole

You can be my pinkie ring from the Dollar Store

Comrade, I know you want me

I know we're perfect for each other

I know you're alone and you need somebody who understands you and I understand you, Commie

You also need someone who knows how to hit that G-spot.
